# Optimisation of Business Processes â€“ Dashboard Project (VU Amsterdam)

This repository contains my assignment for the Optimisation of Business Processes course at VU Amsterdam. The project centers around building an interactive dashboard using Python, Dash, and Plotly to help visualize and manage the flow of incoming patients in a hospital setting.

#### Project Overview
In this assignment, we were provided with distributions of incoming patients and tasked with developing a tool to support better decision-making in hospital resource management.
The dashboard lets users explore how different factors like patient type, length of stay, recovery likelihood, and post-discharge care needs impact patient flow and hospital efficiency. By adjusting these parameters, users can simulate various scenarios and gain insight into how to improve operations and care outcomes.

#### Includes
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Built with Dash and Plotly for real-time, user-friendly visualizations of patient data and hospital capacity.
- **Scenario Simulation**: Users can tweak parameters such as patient types, expected stay duration, and care needs to explore different planning strategies.
