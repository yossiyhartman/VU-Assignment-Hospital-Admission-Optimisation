## Optimisation of Business Processes Course - Dashboard Project
Welcome to my repository for the Optimisation of Business Processes course assignment at VU Amsterdam. This project showcases a dynamic dashboard created with Python, leveraging the Dash and Plotly to visualize and manage the allocation and handling of incoming patients in a hospital setting.

### Project Overview
For this project, We were given distributions of incomming patients. The dashboard developed for this assignment integrates various parameters, such as type of patient, expected stay duration, likelihood of recovery, and the need for homecare post-discharge, to optimize the patient flow and resource allocation within a hospital. Through this interactive tool, users can simulate different scenarios by adjusting parameters to observe potential outcomes and make informed decisions to improve efficiency and patient care.

### Key Features
- Interactive Data Visualization: Utilizes Dash and Plotly for real-time, interactive data visualizations.
- Scenario Simulation: Allows users to adjust parameters like patient type, expected stay, and more to test different hospital management strategies.
- Optimization Insights: Provides actionable insights on how to place and handle patients effectively, improving overall hospital efficiency.
